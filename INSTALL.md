### [Starship](https://starship.rs)

#### Variants

There are two variants of the theme:

- Palette: `starship.toml`. It provides the default Dracula colors, works with the default prompt character or any other user custom setup.
- Theme: `starship.theme.toml`, rename it as `starship.toml`. It provides the Dracula colors and, in addition to the palette, some customized setup including a lambda prompt character.
Feel free to use the one that you prefer, or integrate the Dracula colors in your own setup.

#### Install manually

Download using the [GitHub .zip download](https://github.com/dracula/starship/archive/master.zip) option and unzip them.

#### Activating theme

Copy the `starship.toml` or `starship.theme.toml` (and rename) from the unzipped download to `~/.config/starship.toml` if the file doesn't exist, otherwise append the content to the existing file and make sure you understand the changes.

#### Installing using Nix home-manager

If you're a [Nix Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) user add the following to your home-manager config .nix

This setup was tested using zsh, change line 3 below if you're using a shell other than zsh.

```nix
{
programs.starship = {
  enable = true;
  enableZshIntegration = true;
  settings = {
    aws.style = "bold #ffb86c";
    cmd_duration.style = "bold #f1fa8c";
    directory.style = "bold #50fa7b";
    hostname.style = "bold #ff5555";
    git_branch.style = "bold #ff79c6";
    git_status.style = "bold #ff5555";
    username = {
      format = "[$user]($style) on ";
      style_user = "bold #bd93f9";
    };
    character = {
      success_symbol = "[λ](bold #f8f8f2)";
      error_symbol = "[λ](bold #ff5555)";
    };
  };
};
}
```
